# About
This tool is in an early BETA. I'm planning to expand further, as I'm doing college work a lot. This tool can be used to hack into websites illegally. You have been warned. There are currently only 3 Google Dorks on here. However, I do plan to add a lot more to this tool.

# Usage

```
$ python dborking.py
```
